<h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Chole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish consisting of spicy chickpeas (chole) served with deep-fried bread
    (bhature). This mouthwatering combination is a favorite among food lovers.</p>
<p>To make this delightful dish, start by soaking 1 cup of chickpeas overnight and then pressure cook them until tender.
    In a separate pan, heat oil and add cumin seeds, finely chopped onions, ginger-garlic paste, and green chilies.
    Sauté until the onions turn golden brown. Next, add tomato puree, along with a blend of aromatic spices such as
    turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and garam masala. Cook the masala until the oil
    separates. Now, add the cooked chickpeas, season with salt, and simmer for a while to allow the flavors to meld
    together. For the bhature, knead a dough using all-purpose flour, yogurt, salt, and a pinch of baking soda. Roll out
    the dough into small discs and deep-fry them until golden brown and puffed. Serve the flavorful chole with hot and
    fluffy bhature, garnished with freshly chopped coriander leaves and a side of pickles or yogurt.</p>
<h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup chickpeas (chole), soaked overnight</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons oil for dough + more for frying</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
    <li>2 green chilies, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh coriander leaves for garnishing</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li> In a bowl, rinse 1 cup of chickpeas (chole) under cold water, then soak them in water for 8 hours or overnight.
    </li>
    <li> Drain the soaked chickpeas and transfer them to a pressure cooker. Add 4 cups of water, 2 tea bags (optional),
        and salt to taste. Cook on high heat for 6-7 whistles or until the chickpeas are tender. Allow the pressure to
        release naturally.</li>
    <li> In a separate pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil. Add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and let them splutter. Then add 1
        finely chopped onion and sauté until golden brown.</li>
    <li> Add 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute.</li>
    <li> Add 2 finely chopped tomatoes, 2 teaspoons of chole masala, 1 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon red chili
        powder, and salt to taste. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the spices are well combined.</li>
    <li> Drain the cooked chickpeas, reserving some of the cooking liquid, and add them to the pan. Mix well and cook
        for 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together. If needed, add some of the reserved cooking liquid to
        adjust the consistency of the chole.</li>
    <li> In a separate bowl, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour (maida), 2 tablespoons of semolina (sooji), 1/2
        teaspoon baking powder, a pinch of salt, and 1 tablespoon oil. Gradually add water and knead to form a soft
        dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a circular shape using a rolling pin. Heat oil
        in a deep frying pan and fry the bhature one by one until they puff up and turn golden brown.</li>
    <li> Serve the hot chole with the freshly fried bhature. Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves, sliced
        onions, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Enjoy!</li>
