    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
    <p>Rice Rajma is a delectable Indian dish that combines the richness of kidney beans with fragrant basmati rice. </p>
    <p>To prepare this flavorful recipe, start by soaking 1 cup of rajma (kidney beans) overnight and then pressure cook them until tender. In a separate pan, heat some oil and add cumin seeds, finely chopped onions, ginger-garlic paste, and green chilies. Sauté until the onions turn golden brown. Next, add tomato puree and a blend of aromatic spices such as turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. Cook the masala until the oil separates. Now, add the cooked rajma along with its water, season with salt, and simmer for a while to allow the flavors to meld together. In a separate pot, cook the basmati rice until fluffy and separate. Serve the Rajma over the rice, garnished with fresh coriander leaves. This comforting and hearty Rice Rajma dish is perfect to savor with a side of raita (yogurt dip) or achar (pickle).</p>
